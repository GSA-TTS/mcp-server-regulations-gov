# Build the Regulations.gov MCP server container image and push it to GHCR.
#
# The image is consumed by the Obot MCP gateway as a hosted "containerized"
# MCP server (see the mcp-server-hub-catalog entry). It serves MCP over
# streamable HTTP at :8080/mcp with a health check at :8080/health.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - docker with buildx (for --platform)
#   - Authenticated to GHCR:
#       echo "$GHCR_TOKEN" | docker login ghcr.io -u <github-username> --password-stdin
#     (token needs write:packages scope)
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/build-and-push.sh
#
# The gateway EC2 host is x86_64, so we build linux/amd64 (even from an arm64
# Apple Silicon workstation — buildx handles the emulation). An arm64-only image
# makes the gateway fail with a misleading "No such image ..." error.
#
# This script does NOT bake any secret into the image; the per-user REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY
# is injected at runtime by the gateway.
